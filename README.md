<!--
**mdelaba/mdelaba** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several of my own projects involving automation, robot control, and webscraping.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more advanced neural networks for use in automation.

- ğŸ“« How to reach me: mdelabastide.hba2023@ivey.ca
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him

- âš¡ Why did the programmer quite his job? Because he didn't get arrays :(
